# create and pull a remote branch from a remote
git checkout -b < new_branch > origin/< new_branch >

# create a local branch, do stuff, then push that new branch to the remote repo
git checkout -b mynewfeature
... edit files, add and commit ...
git push -u origin mynewfeature

# rename last commit msg
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

# rollback local repo after a git pull
use git log to find the hash of the desired commit
then git reset --hard 1234abcd where 1234abcd is the hash of the desired commit.

# checking difference between 2 branches and put that log into a file
git diff main-branch..alt-branch > file.name.diff
