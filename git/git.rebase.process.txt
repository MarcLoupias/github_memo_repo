When working on a feature branch, i want to get updates added to the main branch by others dev.
It is mandatory to rebase main-branch in feature-branch before pushing feature-branch to origin.

Workflow is :

1- Work on my feature-branch (created from main-branch)
2- Others people add code on main-branch
3- Work step is done on feature-branch, i commit, i rebase all my commits, THEN i want to add others contrib :

# we on feature-branch, go to main-branch, update it with :
git pull --rebase=preserve <remote> <branch>

git checkout feature-branch

git rebase main-branch

# resolve conflicts then commit WITHOUT ANY MSG
git commit

# finish the rebase
git rebase --continue
