### design

`{ SWAGGER EDITOR }`

> Design new APIs, or edit existing ones, in a powerful Editor which visually renders your Swagger definition with concise, real time feedback and error handling.

### build

`{ SWAGGER CODEGEN }`

> Quickly build APIs by turning your Swagger definition into code, generating server stubs and client libraries in over 40 different languages, allowing for faster deployment and better adoption. 

### document

`{ SWAGGER UI }`

> Visualize your API's resources from its Swagger definition and generate beautiful, interactive documentation that can be hosted in any environment, allowing your end consumers to easily get started with your API.
