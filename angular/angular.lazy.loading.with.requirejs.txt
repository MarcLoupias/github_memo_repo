IMPORTANT :
In fact, using requirejs with angular is not for lazy loading but for lazy downloading.
Angular already lazy load modules. They are executed only when needed.
Require is useful when the website source code is big with many dependencies. 
Downloading everything once can be a problem, especially for mobile websites.
