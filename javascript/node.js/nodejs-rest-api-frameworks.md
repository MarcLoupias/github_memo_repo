## dev frameworks

### express
- [tutorialspoint.com/nodejs : Node.js - RESTful API] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_restful_api.htm)
- [expressjs.com : expressjs hello world] (http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)

### hapi
- [github.com : hapijs/hapi] (https://github.com/hapijs/hapi)
- [hapijs.com] (http://hapijs.com/)

> A rich framework for building applications and services
hapi enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.

### restify
- [restify site off] (http://mcavage.me/node-restify/)

> restify is a node.js module built specifically to enable you to build correct REST web services. It intentionally borrows heavily from express as that is more or less the de facto API for writing web applications on top of node.js.

### sails
- [sailsjs.org] (http://sailsjs.org/)

> Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture. It's especially good for building chat, realtime dashboards, or multiplayer games; but you can use it for any web application project - top to bottom.
